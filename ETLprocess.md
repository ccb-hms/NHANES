The NHANES data is stored on the CDC's website as SAS data files. The extraction process begins with downloading the files before transforming them into flat files. These flat files are then inserted into SQL Server tables as raw data. The schema for this data is '[NhanesLandingZone].[Raw].[TableName]' [download.R L186-362](https://github.com/ccb-hms/NHANES/blob/ce1830c863c6944a2628cfb8fda19d4c94140cf6/Code/R/download.R#L186-L362).  The metadata and ontology tables are downloaded from the [NHANES Metadata Github Repo](https://github.com/ccb-hms/NHANES-metadata) and stored in NhanesLandingZone.Metadata and NhanesLandingZone.Ontology, respectively . The raw data then flows through a transformation process to decode the numerical values within each table to human-readable responses from each questionnaires' corresponding codebook [etlVariableCodebook.R](https://github.com/ccb-hms/NHANES/blob/ce1830c863c6944a2628cfb8fda19d4c94140cf6/Code/R/etlVariableCodebook.R). The transformed data tables reside in the '[Translated]' schema, preserving the original data in the '[Raw]' schema. The design decision to keep the data in its' original format within the database ensures the integrity and traceability of the source information, allowing for accurate verification and re-evaluation in case of any data transformation errors or discrepancies. Performing transformations on copies of the original data tables, rather than the original data itself, enables a safer experimentation and analysis environment, where the original data remains unaltered and available as a reliable reference point for cross-validation and auditing purposes.
